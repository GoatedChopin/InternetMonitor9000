# InternetMonitor9000

ABOUT:
InternetMonitor9000 is a lightweight windows GUI made for the purpose of monitoring and resetting WiFi connection. Such a program is useful for babysitting large downloads with shaky connection, so the end-user doesn't periodically have to check their connection manually to ensure that the download isn't paused indefinitely. Work-in-progress.

LANGUAGES AND LIBRARIES:
InternetMonitor9000 is written entirely in Java, with GUI functionality from the JavaFX library.
